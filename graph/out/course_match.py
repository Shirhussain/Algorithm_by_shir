Graphs
What is a graph?
A graph has two things:
V: Vertices ( or nodes): A set
E: Edges: A set of(u, v) where u, v are in V(note that E can be empty)
Therefore, graph is defined as a pair(tuple) of two sets
G(V, E)

What is a simple graph:
A graph where there are no self loops. We usually only talk about simple graphs because self loops are usually not interesting.

What is the size of a graph?
|V | = n
|E | = m
What is the relation between m, n?
m = O(n ^ 2): in the worst case, m is quadratic compared to n.
In an undirected graph: I can connect n-1 edges to each node. I have n nodes, so the maximum  number of edges would be n(n-1)/2 = O(n ^ 2).
In a directed graph: I can connect n-1 edges to each node. I have n nodes, so the maximum  number of edges would be n(n-1) = O(n ^ 2).
So if they are related, why do we talk about the size of the graph in terms of m, n separately?
Because graphs sometimes miss a lot of potential edges(called sparse graphs). In that case it’s more accurate to talk about the size in terms of m, n rather than just n. The graph on the left has many more edges compared to the graph on the right. But they both have the same number of nodes.

A graph can be directed or undirected

An undirected graph can be converted to directed graph by: replacing each undirected edge with two opposite edges.
Connectivity:
An undirected graph is called connected if I can reach any node from any other node.

A directed graph is called strongly-connected, if I can reach any node from any other node.

Connected component:
Undirected graph: a subgraph that is connected.
Directed graph: a subgraph that is strongly connected.

How to find connected components?
DFS/BFS for undirected graphs
Kosaraju’s for strongly connected components in directed graphs
Tarjan’s algorithm for strongly connected components in directed graphs
Union-find
How do we represent graphs as a data structure?
Direct translation of the definition(e.g. use a set/list for V and a set/list for E)
Adjacency List: a map of a node to a list of adjacent nodes.

Adjacency Matrix: A mapping of each node to all other nodes to 0/1.
Very popular

Which representation should I use?
There is a trade-off between runtime and memory!

How about Grid representation?

This grid is often used to represent a map of a maze.
It is usually represented by a matrix(not to be confused with adjacency matrix)
How to represent this as a graph?
What is V? Each cell
What is E? Each cell has 4 four neighbors(assuming we can only go up/down and left/right)

If some cells are blocked(i.e. have 0). Some potential neighbors don’t exist.


What graph algorithm should I know?
DFS and BFS(Please do not go to any interviews unless you can write these algorithms with your eyes closed!)
Also please remember their runtime/space complexity:
DFS/BFS runtime: O(m+n)
DFS space: O(n), but there is usually a tighter upper bound, which is the depth of the graph(the longest path in the graph)
BFS space: O(n), but there is usually a tighter upper bound, which is the width of the graph.
Topological sort
Cycle detection
Can be done with slight enhancement of DFS

What are some indicators I should use a Graph

How do I solve a Graph problem
Relationship between entities(e.g. social networks)
Connectivity problems(e.g. Find the number of isolated people in a social network or routing problems in a network)
Path finding and shortest path
Cycle detection
Matching problems
Obvious Problems which are defined on graphs: e.g minimum spanning tree.

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]


0  <-----  1




Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
  /------>  \
0  <-----   1




I can take all courses if there are no cycles.
Remember that for topo sort to exist, there should not be aaaaa cycle.


Solution: check if the graph has a cycle (yous can use dfs for this). If so, return false, otherwise true.
