"""
The DFS algorithm works as follows:

Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.
Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.
