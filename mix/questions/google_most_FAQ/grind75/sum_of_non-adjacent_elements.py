# Given an array of positive integers, find the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the array. You need to write a function that returns this maximum sum.

# def max_pair_sum(arr: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
#     pass

# Input: arr: A list of integers
# Output: A tuple containing two integers

# Input: arr = [5, 7,1, 3,1, 2]
# Output: (5, 3)

# Explanation:
# The maximum sum of non-adjacent elements is obtained by selecting elements at indices 0 and 3 (5 + 5 = 10).
