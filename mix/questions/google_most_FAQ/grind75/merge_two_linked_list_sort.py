# s = Solution()

# Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

# Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abccccdd"
# Output: 7
# Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "a"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.

 

# Constraints:

#     1 <= s.length <= 2000
#     s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.
