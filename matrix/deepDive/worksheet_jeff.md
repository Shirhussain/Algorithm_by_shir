How do I know that I should be using a Matrix solution?

- "Matrix" or "2-d Array" or "grid" terminology or examples
- Movement involved with matrix problems

How do I solve a matrix problem?

- Nested loop: simple traversal
- BFS/DFS: graph algorithm approach
- "clever"

Write a template for backtracking (DFS) on a matrix

What is the runtime and space complexity of a Matrix traversal
(nested loop) algorithm?

What is the runtime and space complexity of a Matrix backtracking algorithm?

Runtime: if "neighbors" are up/down/left/right, O(4^(N\*M))
