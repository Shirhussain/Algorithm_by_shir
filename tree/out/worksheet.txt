What are some indicators I should use a Tree to solve a problem?

- It says "tree" in the problem description
- Recursive w/nodes (might be a graph, might be a tree)
- Nested data: hierarchy, XML/HTML
- Heapsort is a tree-oriented sort
- Binary search tree

How do I solve a Tree problem?

- Depth-first search (DFS)
  -- Pre-order: "process" the parent first
        Searching for path from root to something
  -- Post-order: "process" the parent after both children
        Need to "bubble up" (pull) information from the children
  -- Inorder: "process" the parent after the left child, before the right child
        Represents a left-to-right reading of the leaves

- Breadth-first search (BFS)
  -- top-down, left-to-right
  -- Good for processing level-by-level
  -- Finding shortest path to a leaf, for instance

Write a template for a recursive DFS tree traversal

preorder(node, path):
  if node is empty
    return
  visit(node)
  add to path
  preorder(node.left, new path)
  preorder(node.right, new path)
  revert to original path

postorder(node):
  if node is empty
    return
  left_val = postorder(node.left)
  right_val = postorder(node.right)
  return visit(node)
  
inorder(node):
  if node is empty
    return
  inorder(node.left)
  visit(node)
  inorder(node.right)

Write a template for an iterative BFS or DFS tree traversal

bfs(node):
  create a queue
  push node onto queue
  while queue is not empty
     remove new_node from the front of the queue
     visit(new_node)
     push left and right children of new_node onto the queue

What is the runtime & space complexity of a Tree Traversal?

Time: O(# of nodes visited)
DFS Space: O(max depth of tree) 
BFS Space: O(max width of tree)
